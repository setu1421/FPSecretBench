## Introduction

According to GitGuardianâ€™s monitoring of public GitHub repositories, secrets sprawl continued accelerating in 2022 by 67% compared to 2021, exposing over 10 million secrets (API keys and other credentials). Though many open-source and proprietary secret detection tools are available, these tools output many false positives, making it difficult for developers to take action and teams to choose one tool out of many. To our knowledge, the secret detection tools are not yet compared and evaluated. The goal of our study is to aid developers in choosing a secret detection tool to reduce the exposure of secrets through an empirical investigation of existing secret detection tools. We present an evaluation of five open-source and four proprietary tools against a benchmark dataset.

**In addition to comparing nine secret detection tools, we have curated a dataset *FPSecretBench*, which contains the false positives reported by the secret detection tools scanned on the benchmark dataset ([SecretBench](https://github.com/setu1421/SecretBench)). The dataset will aid in expediting the research on improving the accuracy of the tools.** 

## How to Use

The dataset is stored in Google BigQuery. First, you need to create a Google Cloud Account. Google Cloud gives a $300 free credit after opening the account. You can run SQL queries in Google BigQuery to access the false positive secrets.

 - **Google BigQuery Dataset id (*dev-range-332204.fpsecretbench*):**  Google BigQuery contains false positive secrets with additional metadata information regarding the secrets such as repository name, commit id, file path, and start line of where the false positive secret is reported. More details of the metadata is described in [Data Overview](#data-overview) section.

**Important:** *The researchers and developers who want to use our dataset must contact us. Since the dataset may contain mislabeled true positives, a data protection agreement has to be signed with us to avoid any unethical use of the data. Later, we will give access to the dataset using their email addresses.*

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of the false-positive secrets reported by nine secret detection tools below when scanned on the **[SecretBench](https://github.com/setu1421/SecretBench)** dataset. The SecretBench is a benchmark dataset consisting of 818 public GitHub repositories.
